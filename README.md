# Impact of Music on Mental Health — Classification Analysis

_This project is for educational purposes only and does not provide medical or clinical advice._

**Problem**  
Music is often associated with emotional regulation and mental well-being. This project investigates whether music listening habits can be used to predict perceived mental health effects using survey data.

---

**Dataset**

- Survey-based dataset capturing music preferences, listening behavior, and mental health indicators
- Contains categorical features and class imbalance challenges

---

**Approach**

- Cleaned and encoded survey responses for modeling  
- Performed exploratory and statistical analysis to examine correlations
- Applied feature selection techniques to reduce noise
- Addressed class imbalance during model training
- Built and evaluated classification models using standard performance metrics

---

**Results**

- Identified patterns linking music habits to reported mental health effects
- Demonstrated the impact of feature selection and imbalance handling on model performance
- Provided interpretable insights alongside predictive results

_Detailed report with statistical and ML findings available in the `/report` folder._
